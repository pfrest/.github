# Welcome to pfREST

pfREST is a community-driven effort dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of pfSense Community Edition (CE). Our primary goal is to bridge the gap in missing modern features, ensuring that pfSense CE remains a powerful and viable firewall solution for home labs, hobbyists, and organizations alike.

pfSense CE is an incredible open-source platform, but as the landscape of technology evolves, so do the needs of its users. pfREST exists to meet these evolving needs by providing modern, in-demand functionalities that are not available in the core product. From programmatic access via APIs to advanced authentication mechanisms and improved observability, these projects aim to bring next-generation features to the pfSense CE ecosystem.

While projects are specifically developed with pfSense CE in mind, some may also be compatible with or applicable to pfSense Plus.

### A Community Initiative

All projects are developed, maintained, and supported by members of the pfSense community. They are passion projects, born from a desire to make a solid platform even better. We believe in the power of open source and collaborative development to create valuable tools that benefit everyone.

### Support

As these are community-supported projects, support is handled through the "Issues" tab on each project's GitHub repository. If you encounter a bug, have a question, or would like to request a feature, please open an issue in the relevant repository, and we will do our best to assist you.

### Contributing

Contributions from the community are welcome and encouraged! Whether it's reporting a bug, submitting a pull request for a new feature or a bug fix, or simply suggesting a new idea, your input is incredibly valuable. Please check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (if available) in individual project repositories for specific guidelines.
